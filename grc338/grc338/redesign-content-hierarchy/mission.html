    <p>Patti's mission is to provide her Celiac and Gluten Intolerant customers with the highest quality gluten-free baked goods that also taste great.  As a Certified Nutritional Educator who specializes in teaching allergy-free cooking, Patti understands first hand the challenges that people face in obtaining nutritious, healthy foods when your food choices become limited.  Many of her clients had difficulty in making all their own foods from "scratch" and wished that they had better pre-made allergy-free food choices.</p>
    <p>Wanting to learn more about the gluten-free, and allergy-free food industry, Patti started working as a nutritional consultant at "People and Planet" in Morgan Hill, CA., a store that specializes in gluten-free food products.  Patti soon discovered that the commercial gluten-free baked products and packaged baked good mixes were substandard in both nutrition and taste.  She began experimenting with different gluten-free flours and mixes in order to improve the taste, texture, and rise of her baked goods.  She then asked her gluten-free friends and her wheat eating friends to give her feedback. The response was overwhelmingly positive and her customers urged her to start baking for them. </p>
    <p>In order to provide the best tasting gluten-free baked goods Patti only uses the highest quality organic and natural ingredients.  In her gluten-free items that contain dairy she uses AA unsalted butter and buttermilk that are hormone free.  She refuses to use trans-fats and bakes her dairy-free baked goods with palm, coconut and grape seed oils. When you eat one of Patti's sweet treats you will be pleasantly surprised that they are not over sweetened.   Most baked goods sold today have way too much sugar which is destroying our health.  Patti's sugar of choice is organic and unrefined cane sugar.  Her baked goods are also made in small batches to keep the quality high.</p>
