        <h3>Black Tea</h3>
        <h4>Irish Black</h4>
    <p>The Organic Irish Breakfast Tea is a traditional Irish Breakfast tea, created from malty Assam teas from North Eastern India, and is commonly mixed with a little milk and sugar. The color is superb and full bodied. Organic Irish Breakfast delivers a good, strong cuppa.

</p>
        <h4>Seeyok Darjeeling</h4>
        <p>Seeyok Darjeeling Tea is a golden leaf, rich brown color and its flavor has a slight floral uplift.  For a fun and dynamic flavor, go for this toasty yet traditional and well-balanced Indian organic black loose leaf tea. The sea of contrasts contained within Seeyok Darjeeling will be a thrill for those with an adventurous palette!</p>
        <h4>Apricot Black Tea</h4>
        <p>
Imagine being whisked away to a perfumy, fresh apricot orchard... That's the sensation you'll get with your first sip of our delectable Apricot Black tea. This tea combines the sweet flavor of ripe summer apricots with the tangy bright taste of Ceylon black tea.  Soft, mellow mouth feel, succulent flavor and balanced astringency</p>
        <h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
        <h4>Oolong Tea</h4>
        <p>Oolong tea is a semi-fermented tea, integrating the best qualities of un-oxidized green tea and fully oxidized black tea. It has the richest taste among all kinds of teas. It is as strong and refreshing as black tea and also as clear and fragrant as green tea.
</p>
        <h3>Green Tea</h3>
        <h4>Moroccan Mint</h4>
    <p>A true palate cleanser, this exciting and refreshing blend of green tea and Moroccan spearmint mingle together perfectly. Voyage to the famed Gates of Africa with every refined palate-pleasing sip. Perfect as is, or with some sugar, agave nectar or honey.
</p>
        <h4>Chinese Gunpowder</h4>
        <p>Gunpowder tea is green tea that is rolled up into a small black pellet; thus its very descriptive name. Rolling the leaves has a beneficial effect on the quality of the tea. Not only does it force to the surface flavorful juices that otherwise would remain in the leaf, but the pellet retains its shape during firing and keeps its freshness longer than other loose leaf teas. This tea tastes bold and lightly smoky. Chinese Gunpowder tea is higher in caffeine than most other green teas.

</p>
        <H3>Herbal Tea</H3>
    <h4>Ruby Red Hibiscus Ginger</h4>
    <p>A blend of the red hibiscus flower from Pakistan with dried ginger root from northern India. This tea has a tart, fruity taste with a spicy ginger aftertaste.  Hibiscus is full of vitamin C and has been used for generations as a kidney cleanser because of its natural diuretic properties.</p>

<h4>Lemon Ginger Chamomile</h4>

<p>A fresh mix of handpicked chamomile, sun dried lemon peels, and cut ginger brewed together create a soothing, mellow tea that is not too tart or spicy. This soothing tea is a mellow blend.
</p>
        <h3>Blended Tea</h3>

<h4>Royal Earl Grey</h4>

<p>A black tea infused with the oil of the bergamot citrus and cornflower blossoms. Smooth flavors balanced with a citrus taste.</p>

<h4>Ceylon Green Orange Pekoe</h4>

<p>A green tea brewed from high mountain tea leaves with a rich aroma. A strong pekoe flavor with subtle citric nuances is prevalent in this blend. From the Sri Lankan central highland tea estates in Idalgashinna comes this fabulous green tea. The Ceylon green tea is a richer more pungent version of its cousins in Assam, Zhejiang, and Uji. This tea has a darker and malty flavor with light citrus notes.</p>
