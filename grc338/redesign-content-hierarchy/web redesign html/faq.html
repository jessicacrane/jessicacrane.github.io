    <h1>What Inspired Patti to Start Baking Gluten-Free Products?</h1>
    <p> In 2008, Patti's health was beginning to suffer. Although she exercised, and cooked all her own food from scratch, she was prediabetic, exhausted, and suffered from moderate to severe muscle aches and pains.  A close friend told her about the symptoms associated with gluten-intolerance and urged her to take it out of her diet to see if it helped.  After three weeks of going GF she began to feel better and she regained her energy.  This inspired her to learn more about nutrition and food intolerance which led to her obtaining a Certification in Nutritional Education.  In March of 2010, Patti launched The Food Fixx, L.L.C..  Her goal was to teach people how to cook "real food' in order to preserve or regain their health.  The majority of her clients suffered from food allergies and intolerance and wanted Patti to teach them how to cook for their allergic conditions.  In April of 2011, Patti started working as a consultant for the People and Planet Store in Morgan Hill, CA, a health food store specializing in Gluten-Free foods.  She learned that the majority of the gluten-free commercial baked goods and commercial mixes were a major disappointment in the areas of taste and nutrition.  Patti started bringing in the baked goods she was experimenting on for her allergy clients and asking the store customers to try them and give her feedback.  Her colleagues and customers urged her to start baking for the store.  In December 2011, Patti started "Patti's Perfect Pantry" to  supply Gluten-Free baked goods for the People and Planet store in Morgan Hill, CA. </p>
